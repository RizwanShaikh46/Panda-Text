        note: 'Mass media and popular culture have the capacity to shape the values and norms of society. Incontemporary society, the role of the celebrity is particularly pervasive. The Kardashians are an American family with their own TV show (“Keeping up with the Kardashians”). As such, they are an example of the mass media genre of “reality TV” and the celebration of the celebrity. Moreover, theKardashians are the epitome of popular culture because their show and subsequent lifestyles reflectconsumerist values, trivial pastimes and superficiality. '

        note: `Once upon a time there lived a lion in a forest. One day after a heavy meal. It was sleeping under a tree. After a while, there came a mouse and it started to play on the lion. Suddenly the lion got up with anger and looked for those who disturbed its nice sleep. Then it saw a small mouse standing trembling with fear. The lion jumped on it and started to kill it. The mouse requested the lion to forgive it. The lion felt pity and left it. The mouse ran away.



        On another day, the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. The mouse came there and cut the net. Thus it escaped. There after, the mouse and the lion became friends. They lived happily in the forest afterwards.

        note: `nd content. “That was delicious, but there is something missing tonight," said the donkey.

        “What is that?" asked the jackal. “Why, music of course," answered the donkey, looking a little surprised.
        
        The jackal asked, “Where are we going to get music from?" The donkey said. “Don’t you know that I am an accomplished singer?"
        
        The jackal was alarmed. "Remember, we are in an orchard. If the farmer hears us, we will be in trouble. If you want to sing let us go away from here," he advised the donkey.
        
        "You think I can't sing, don't you?" asked the donkey in a hurt voice.
        
        “Wait till you hear me."
        
        The jackal realised that the donkey was not willing to take his good advice. He moved away and hid himself behind a clump of trees. The donkey threw back his head and started his song. “He …haw, hee-haw," he brayed aloud.
        
        The farmers hearing the loud braying came rushing with sticks and gave the foolish donkey a severe beating that left the donkey feeling sore all over.
        
        After the farmers had left, the jackal went over to his friend. He said. “Is this the prize you won for your singing?"
        
        “They don’t appreciate good music," replied a hurt and ashamed donkey.
        
        The jackal replied. “This is what happens when you don’t listen to the advice given by a good friend. I hope you have learnt a lesson."`

        note: `In a forest there lived a lion. He had grown old and could not run fast anymore. As days went by it became more and more difficult for him to hunt.

        One day while he was wandering through the forest in search of food, he came across a cave. He peeped in and smelt the air inside the cave. “Some animal must be staying here," he said to himself. He crept inside the cave only to find it empty. “I will hide inside and wait for the animal to return," he thought.
        
        The cave was the home of a jackal. Everyday, the jackal would go out in search of food and return to the cave in the evening to rest. That evening, the jackal after having his meal started towards home. But as he came closer, he felt something wrong. Everything around him very quiet. “Something is wrong," the jackal said to himself. “Why are all the birds and insects so silent?"`

        note: `In a forest close to the river bank mere lived a crane with his wife. They were very unhappy. Every time the wife laid eggs in their nest, a big black cobra who lived in a hollow in the tree, would eat them up. The crane had a friend the crab. He went to his friend the crab and shared his misery. "I feel so hopeless….That sneaking thief has eaten our eggs again," complained the crane angrily.

        “Don’t worry," said the crab comfortingly. “You need not be hopeless when you have a friend like me. We will come up with a solution."`
